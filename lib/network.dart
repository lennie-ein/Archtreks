        "This program is designed to suit people with very little time, it's only 3 nights on the Mountain. This creative climb joins two of the most scenic routes up Mount Kenya, Sirimon and Chogoria, producing a remarkably diverse and spectacular trek. Sirimon coming off the west of Mount Kenya passes through the dry side of the mountain with its giant trees and rocky terrain, and the descent onto the Chogoria path is exactly different with its lush bamboo and highland forests.\nThe final night, the ascent to Point Lenana can be as difficult as any ascent in East Africa, but the rest of the trek is generally considered easier than either Kilimanjaro or the Rwenzori’s.\nDay 1: Nairobi – Sirimon gate- Old Moses camp. (3,300m) 3-4 hrs, 9km walk, 680mascent.\nAfter pick up in Nairobi, drive to Nanyuki town for lunch crossing the equator en route to the Sirimon Park gate (2660m). From the gate, we trek up through magnificent montane forest, bamboo and giant heather zone before reaching the high altitude moorland and our first hut (Old Moses Bandas 3,300m) for dinner and overnight. This is a gentle trek that takes 3 – 4 hrs gaining an elevation of 680m.\n3 hrs walking time.\nMeals: Lunch and Diner\nAccommodation: Old Moses Bandas {Inside the Park} \nDay 2: Old Moses – Shipton’s camp (4200m). 7 hrs, 14km, 900m ascent.\nAfter breakfast, follow the track uphill, forking right at the junction.

With a good Moon, you barely need a torch. Without a Moon, then the pollution-free sky bangs on the ground giving you as good a view of the stars as almost anywhere on Earth. The climb takes 3 -4 hrs and to add to the exhilaration, Mt. Kilimanjaro is also visible from the horizon. Descend to Minto’s hut for a full breakfast. After a short rest descend further to Mt Kenya bandas along the gorges valley where you can enjoy good views of The Temple, Lake Michaelson, Mushroom rocks and Giant billiards table.  Dinner and overnight at the Chogoria route Gate Campsite.\n8 /10hrs walking time.\nMeals:  Breakfast, Lunch and Diner\nAccommodation: Mt.

Reaching the highest of the three peaks on Mount Kenya requires technical expertise, but the third-highest peak of Point Lenana offers the finest six-day trek on the continent. Our hike will take our trekkers through the dense rain forest, which encircle the lower slopes of the mountain, which is home to Elephant, Cape buffalo, Leopard and primates. We then traverse the vast moorlands, past undulating grassy valleys and deep rocky gorges, through some of the most fabulous vegetation on our planet. We arrive at the summit of Lenana early enough to be rewarded by views of the new day dawning across East Africa.\n "

        "Day 1: Nairobi- Park gate - Old Moses campsite (altitude: 3300m)\nLeave Nairobi at 0645am for a 3.5-hour trip to Nanyuki where you will link up with the porters and make final preparations and continue the journey to the mountain park Gate. We start out trekking at the Sirimon Gate and walk up to Old Moses Camp Site. The zone is in a lush mountain rainforest with Hagena rosewood, St. John’s Wort, giant Camphor trees, Yellow Wood trees, ferns, orchids and other epiphytes. Along the way, as you walk, there is a good chance of seeing various species of monkeys, antelopes and birds. Buffalo, zebra and elephant can often be seen in forest glades as well as a warthog. As we gain altitude the forest merges into bamboo that can reach over ten metres in height. This first day is approximately 2.5 hrs walking. Dinner and Overnight at the Old Moses Campsite or you may opt to sleep in Bandas\nDay 2. Old Moses to  Shiptons Camp (altitude: 4,200m)\nAfter breakfast proceed across Ontulilli River straight to Liki North River We backtrack a little up to a ridge and drier ground. Now we have the feeling of approaching the high peaks. As the moorland valley opens up there is often a profusion of white and yellow alpine flowers. If we are lucky we may see Verreaux eagles and maybe Auger buzzards.  Continue to the top ridge and down to Mackinder's Valley and Shipton's Camp at 4200m. This is a 9kms walk which takes 4 hrs, picnic lunch is served upon arrival at the Shiptons Camp. You have the option of staying in the hut or sleeping in your own tents. The tents offer a bit of privacy and quiet from the often busy hut. Either way, our cook will use the hut's facilities and we will take our meals at tables and benches inside the hut.This Night you will be joined by the Technical Guide/s and you will do a Briefing and a Kit/ Technical Gear Check\n Day 3: Shiptons Camp 4200m- Point Lenana\nWe start our trek to Point Lenana in the early hours of the morning 3 am so that we can enjoy the early morning sun on the summit of Lenana and view the spectacular main peaks. Most early mornings are very clear in the high mountain area but you can expect the clouds to roll in by mid-morning. Before that happens we want to be back at camp after enjoying our summit time to the full. Rest after Lunch and at 3 pm climbing a short route on either Point Peter (this is also technical) or Point Dutton But you can also opt to rest and Spare the Energy. In either case, you also prepare for the climb of Batian the following morning by visiting the base... just to get acquainted with the start point.\n \n \nDay 4:   Summit Attempt 5199m\nAscent of Batian by the North Face Standard Route. Starting before dawn, usually between 4 and 5 am, you may climb the first couple of pitches by headlamp.  The route initially follows a wide contour which you ascend for some 7 pitches, never harder than 5.7. A bit of easy scrambling brings you to the Amphitheatre, a small basin of easy rock part-way up the route. Ideally, you arrive here by about 7.30 am and enjoy a late, 'breakfast' and a short break.\nAbove this is the crux of the route, Fermin’s Tower. There are about 3 difficult pitches, all fairly short, but all in the 5.8 to 5.9 range. Above this, easier terrain leads to a few more pitches and finally, the west ridge.\nFrom this point, you continue on easy, but still exposed, rock to Shipton's Notch, a prominent gash in the summit ridge. Another pitch then mixed 4th and easy 5th-class rock leads to the airy summit of Batian. Descent is by the same route, with a few minor variations. If we are quick we can arrive back at Shipton's Camp before evening dusk. If you are slow be able to go up and down the Same Day,\nNB:\nPlease plan for Seven days in case you spend the Night at the Top Hut,\n \nDay 5: .. Spare Date Just in Case of Bad weather or Otherwise\n \nDay 6: Shiptons Camp to Chogoria  bandas\n After Spending the night at Shiptons we will Use the Chogoria route, because we believe it is the most scenic on the Mountain. The trek out begins with a climb up to Simba Col, then a quick descent to the Hall Tarns. From here we follow the backbone of a ridge, overlooking the beautiful Gorges Valley. \nLoosing elevation we leave the high moorlands and enter into the forest belt which surrounds Mount Kenya. As we approach the rustic cabins of Meru Mount Kenya Lodge (our destination for the night) we are likely to see Cape buffalo, as well as Bush Buck or Water Buck, and tracks of other wild animals. \nThe Bandas, as the cabins are called, are a welcome luxury after our stay on the mountain. With hot showers after( the water is wood-fire heated) and a fine evening fire, we enjoy dinner and the thick, fragrant air of the jungly lower elevations. In the evening we can make a short hike with our Kenyan guide, looking for additional wildlife and exploring the immediate area around our cabins.\n \nDay 7:  Chogoria bandas to Nairobi or your Next destination.\nWe may choose to hike for the first hour or so, enjoying the thick bamboo forest. We often see elephant tracks, and signs of many other wild animals. \nAfter a bit of time, our Vehicle catches up with us, for the rest of the Journey through the forest we continue to drive to Chogoria town on the east side of Mount Kenya. Transfer to Nairobi to Reach by 230pm\nEnd of Safari\n"

(4,100m) 4 hrs, 12km, 560m ascent.\nThis is a long day comparatively so an early start is inevitable.  You start on a well off-the-beaten track to follow a ridge up the mountain for about 3 hours to eventually join the tourist track on the normal Chogoria route at an altitude of about 4,100m. Breathe taking views over the Gorges Valley and back over towards Ithanguni and the Northern Moorlands. Lunch is served at a small stream crossing, before continuing for an additional hour to the Lake Michaelson campsite 4,100m for our night’s rest. The afternoon is spent relaxing at camp, though a 10-minute walk to the edge of the Lake drain is well worth the effort.  \n•\tMain Destination: Mt. Kenya National Park.
